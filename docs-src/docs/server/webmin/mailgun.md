    Learn how to set up the __Mailgun__ settings in a screencast format by __[Clicking here](/screencasts/#email-module)__.

If you're planning on using either the client or server-side __Email__ module or requiring your users to confirm registration by email with the __Users__ module, then you will need a valid __[Mailgun](https://mailgun.com)__ account.

Once you have your account set-up you will need to provide your _Sending Domain_ and _Secret API Key_ from Mailgun to your Coronium Core system.

Using the __[Webmin](/server/webmin/setup/)__, navigate to the __Configuration__ section and enter the requested information under the __Mailgun__ tab. Click the __Update__ button to add your credentials.

You can now use the __Email__ module, confirm user registrations, and send password resets with both the client-side and server-side __Users__ module.
