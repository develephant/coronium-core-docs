# Reboot

After the __Coronium Core__ installation runs, it is wise to reboot the server instance, so that you can free up any memory that may have been used during the installation process.

On the command line, enter:

```
sudo reboot -h
```

This will start the reboot process. Wait 15-30 seconds before using the server. All processes will automatically reload.
