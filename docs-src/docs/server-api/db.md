# Overview

The __DB__ module provides simple access to a document style (schema-less) datastore.

!!! note
    While the __DB__ module uses Mongo, it is a simple abstraction layer providing basic functionality. It is not a full Mongo client. For complex query needs it is recommended that you use the __[MySQL](server-api/mysql/)__ module.
